= Mintty Theme Selector

Python script to change `mintty` color scheme from the command line

* https://github.com/mintty/mintty/wiki/Tips[Save themes under `~/.mintty/themes`]
* Install the script -- `pip install .`
* Select a theme -- `mts my-theme` where `my-theme` is a regex which will be matched against theme filenames without extension, so `mts my-theme$` and similar works.
