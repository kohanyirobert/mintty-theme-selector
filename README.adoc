= Mintty Theme Selector

Python script to change `mintty` color scheme from the command line

* Install the script with `./install.sh` -- it'll try to create `~/bin` and symlink `mts.py` to `~/bin/mts`.
* Save themes under `~/.mintty/themes` https://github.com/mintty/mintty/wiki/Tips[according to the documentation].
* Use `mts my-theme` to apply it -- the program tries to match the name of the theme file without the extension with a regex so `mts my-theme$` and similar will work.
